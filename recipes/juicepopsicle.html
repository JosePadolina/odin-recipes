    <h2 class="description">Description</h2>
    <p>
      Popsicles are the ultimate in edible luxury during the summer months, and
      what’s even better is that they can be plant based, gluten free, sugar
      free and even healthy. Popsicles were reportedly invented in 1905 when
      11-year old Frank Epperson accidentally left a container of powdered soda
      and water, with a mixing stick inside, on his San Francisco porch
      overnight. All it took was an unexpectedly cold night for the popsicle to
      be born—which Epperson would commercially debut as an Epsicle in 1923.
      Epperson’s children eventually convinced him to file a patent for the
      frozen treat under the name popsicle.
